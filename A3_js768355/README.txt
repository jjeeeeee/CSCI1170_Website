Styles.css:

Lines 2-44 are used to for styling that applies to general things throughout all webpages:

	Lines 2-9 create CSS variables that I used throughout the website by using the :root selector which makes it apply to all of the code in the HTML documents(s). Here, colours and sizes were defined for uniformness and consistency throughout the website

	Lines 12-17 is used to style all of the elements with specific rules, again to maintin consistency throughout the website, and also because without these rules, the styling of some elements simply would not work. This was done using the universal selector on line 12

	Lines 20-25 are used to style the majority of the images throughout the website, as I am using a class selector. This styled their border, padding and margins.

	Lines 28-30 are used to style the header container and give the space so that they appear underneath the navigation bar

	Lines 33-37 style the unordered lists, so that they get rid of the dot to make them more visually pleasing

	Lines 40-44 are used to style the headers in the website consistently

Lines 51-90 are used to style the navigation bar:

	Lines 51-60 are used to style the container for the navigation bar. The overall container is given colour, set to a fixed position so that when scrolling it remains in the same position, and is also set to be a flexbox, which allows the content within the navigation bar to be arranged much easier and better. It also defines positioning rules which allow for the content to be arranged is a visually connected and pleasing way. The last thing is the addition of a z-index rule, so that the navigation bar will always remain on top of elements when scrolling, as the default value for all other elements is 1

	Lines 65-68 are used to style the container that holds the word links in the navigation bar. I had separated the overall navigation container into 2 flex items, so I could arrange them to match that of a proper navigation bar. This container is one of the flex items. Within this container, I also define it to be a grid, so that I can easily arrange all of the links

	Lines 72-78 style the actual links so that they can look more visually appealing and connected. This is done with changing the colour, font, borders, adding some padding, and finally getting rid of the underline with the text-decoration rule
	
	Lines 81-84 are used to style the links when the mouse hovers over them, which is done using the pseudo-class selector :hover. This just changes the background colour and font colour so that the user knows that it is a clickable link, and that they are hovering over it

	Lines 87-90 are used to style the container that holds the image link, which is the second flex item in the navigation container. This is just given padding and alignment so that it is placed with more intent and purpose, and so it is more visually connected with the rest of the content in the navigation bar

Lines 97-175 are used to style the Index page:

	Lines 97-104 are used to style the container that holds all of the content in the main page. This is set to a grid so that I am able to connect the content better. It is also given rules that adjust the positioning of its items, so that the content appeals to the proximity and alignment principles

	Lines 107-118 are used to style the text in the captivating introduction section. This styles the colours, font, and adjusts the content so that it is in the centre of the container. The container is also given the same border and background as the rest of the containers in the website for consistency. This grid item is also given a grid-area value, so it can easily be arranged in the parent container

	Lines 121-123 make use of the pseudo-element selector to make the first line of the header smaller so that it emphasises my name as it is bigger than the rest of the text

	Lines 125-127 are used to make the rest of the header content that I do not wamt to emphasis smaller that is contained within the span container

	Lines 131-138 are used to style the container that holds the preview of projects that I have done. This is again given the same border, background colour and rules for alignment for consistency, and also given a grid-area value so that it can be easily arranged in the parent container

	Lines 141-145 are used to style the image the is presented in the preview of work section and given CSS rules to make it visually aligned with the container

	Lines 148-153 are used to style the contaier tha holds the personal introduction with CSS rules to position it correctly, as well as give it a grid-area value so that it can be easily arranged in the parent container

	Lines 156-160 are used to style the profile picture that is present, changing its border and giving it a width in the CSS file rather than in the HTML code

	Lines 163-175 style the About page link exactly the same as the links in the navigation bar, it is only separated here because I do not want the link to be a block display, but rather maintain its inlie property

Lines 182-230 are used to style the About page:
	
	Lines 182-185 style the mission statement font and alignment so that it is better presented
	
	Lines 189-193 style the container that holds the content of the page, setting it to be a flexbox for better arrangement of the content. All of the content is also given the same font colour for consistency, and elements are separated to abide by the proximity principle.

	Lines 106-203 are used to style the background information section. The container is styled to match the rest of the containers in the website, and it is given the proper CSS rules so that its content is aligned well inside the container

	Lines 206-208 makes use of the sibling selector to add a margin only around the paragraphs after the first, so that it does not separate the paragraphs from the header (which would happen if I were to only use the p selector, not the sibling selector), while separating paragraphs with different information
	
	Lines 211-215 are used to style the container tha holds the skills and attributes unordered list which styles it the same as the rest of the website containers

	Lines 218-223 style the list items in this list, as well as the nested list present in the Experience page. This gives the list items a different background so that they stand out subtly from the background colour of the container

Lines 230-305 are used to style the Experience page:

	Lines 230-233 are used to make the header a flexbox, so that I can easily align the table in the centre of the page

	Lines 236-238 are used to change the font size of the header to a larger font to match the size of the table header, which adheres to the consistency principle

	Lines 241-243 are used to style the font in the table header

	Lines 246-248 are used to give padding to the table elements to make it look more visually appealing
	
	Lines 251-255 give a border to the table, and the table data, and collapses it so that they are all one border which makes it more visually presentable

	Lines 258-262 make the container that holds the main content of the page a flexbox, which allows for easy positioning of the elements
	
	Lines 265-273 are used to style the container tha holds the Experimental Robotics video that I present, making it the same style as the other containers, as well as giving it CSS rules that present the content better

	Lines 276-280 style the actual video that is present in the container, giving it a border and specifying the width in the CSS file rather than the HTML code 

	Lines 283-291 are used to style the placeholder container that is present in the projects section. This is a class selector incase I want to add more placeholders, so I would not have to add any additional CSS to make it the same as the present one. This is given the same visual style as the other containers, as well as alignment CSS rules to present the text in the centre

	Lines 294-300 are used to style the achievements container that holds the nested list, which is already styled from the multiple selector presented in the code above. This makes the presentation of the container the same as the rest of the containers on the website

	Lines 303-305 add padding to all the list elements in the nested list

Lines 312-179 are used to style the Interests page:

	Lines 312-323 style the container that holds all of the content of the page, making it a grid display so that I can easily arrange the content of the page. More CSS rules are defined to make the layout of the grid more visually appealing

	Lines 326-332 are used to style the continer that holds the presentation of the book I'm interested in. This style makes the container display the same as the rest of the containers in the website, and adds a grid-area property so that I can arrange the grid easily in the parent conatainer

	Lines 355-341 are used to stye the container that holds the audio that I have presented in the website. This again makes the container display the same as the rest of the containers in the website, and adds a grid-area property so that I can arrange the grid easily in the parent conatainer

	Lines 344-347 style the audio player to give the same border as the rest of the containers for consistency

	Lines 350-356 are for styling the container that holds the embedded YouTube video. This styling makes the container display the same as the rest of the containers in the website, and adds a grid-area property so that I can arrange the grid easily in the parent conatainer

	Lines 359-365 stle the container that holds the picture of the MacKay bridge. This styling makes the container display the same as the rest of the containers in the website, and adds a grid-area property so that I can arrange the grid easily in the parent conatainer

	Lines 368-374 style the container that holds the picture of my badminton team. This styling makes the container display the same as the rest of the containers in the website, and adds a grid-area property so that I can arrange the grid easily in the parent conatainer

	Lines 377-379 make use of the adjacent sibling selector so that I am able to make only the paragraph underneath the audio player have a top margin that it not directly under it. I used this selector because it was only that paragraph that I needed to style like this.

Lines 386-426 are used to style to contact page:

	Lines 386-388 are used to give a margin to the top of the form so that it appears under the navigation bar

	Lines 291-398 are used to style the container the holds the form. The container is made the same as the containers in the rest of the website as detailed in many previous sections. 

	Lines 401-403 make use of the sibling selector to style list items that are siblings of list elements that are contained within the form. This is to add spacing between the input areas so that it looks more visually pleasing

	Lines 406-410 are used to style the labels, which makes them uniform for each input that they are labelling, and also to make it better resemble a professional form

	Lines 413-416 are used to style the input boxes (and text area), making them se same width, and aligned properly

	Lines 419-422 are used to give padding to the submit button

	Lines 424-426 make use of the child and attribute selector, so that only the inputs in the form are given this specific type of border, which also makes the form feel more detailed as opposed to having simply plain borders
