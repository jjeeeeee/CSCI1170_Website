                My Background
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although I had original aspirations in general science, I applied to complete a 
                Computer Science degree at Dalhousie University as it opens a very wide field of 
                possible professions within the industry. Since starting my degree, and even 
                within high school when writing an <i>extended essay</i> for the International Baccalaureate 
                program, I felt that eventually I may want to get into the cyber security industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my life I have always participated in team activities and sports such as 
                soccer, volleyball, badminton, and team track and field events such as the 100m relay. 
                This has allowed me to develop my inter-personal skills, as well, experience and develop 
                skills that allow me to easily work with many different types of people with a diverse range 
                of perspectives, ideas, and backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also had a co-op placement at CBCL in Halifax for structural engineering. 
                This have given me the experience of being in a workplace environement, and has 
                allowed me to established inter-diciplinary connections with many people.
