                    Evil Genius is a book that I take particular interest in as 
                    the entire plot fully envelops the reader from start to finish. 
                    I particularly enjoy books of the Sci-fi genre, and this is no exception.
                    In fact, I enjoyed this book so much, it was a must to read the rest of the 
                    trilogy: <i>Genius Squad</i>, and <i>The Genius Wars</i> which I would highly recommend.   <!--i tags used because it is necessary to italicize book titles-->

                    This is a piece called "Magnetic Rag" composed by Scott Joplin, and
                    in the case of this recording, performed by Constantin Stephan. This was
                    the piece that I played to win the Nova Scotia Kiwanis Music Festival competition
                    for grade 8 Jazz in 2018.

                This is a genre of music called lofi, which I tend to listen to when I need to get work done as 
                there are no lyrics, and the music is quite calming to listen to. I find that I am very productive when 
                I listen to this type of music, and would recommned to anybody that struggles with concentration while doing work.

                Although I am not big into photography, I can still appreciate a good photo when I see one. 
                And despite my photography skills not being exceptionally good, I do try to capture the scenary  
                when I see approriate. This is a picture of the MacKay Bridge in Halifax Nova Scotia during sunset.

                This is a picture of a waterfall I had visited which I thought looked very scenic.
                It is in a very out of the way location, however the process of getting to it is worth it.

                Throughout junior high and high school, I enjoyed playing doubles badminton both leisurely, and 
                competitively. Due to COVID-19, I was only able to play competitively in my senior year of high school, 
                but I was able to win the metro and regional tournaments in doubles.
